To install this package, type 
python setup.py install --user

This tool is used to generate a set of object's stable placement with its feasible grasp poses. Those result
will be stored into a sql database.

Assume you are in the grasping_analysis directory.
1. add the object name and id into the database by adding the following code before "db.close()"

	sql = """insert into object(idobject, name) values ([#id],[object name])"""
	try:
    		cursor.execute(sql)
    		db.commit()
	except:
    		db.rollback()

2. run the following command to generate the database.
	python create_tables.py

3. add the object mesh(.stl) file into to manipulation/grip/objects. (the unit in those file should be mm)

4. modify the object name in manipulation/grip/freegrip_fetch.py
	"obj_path = os.path.join(this_dir, "objects", "bottle.stl")" -> "obj_path = os.path.join(this_dir, "objects", "[object name].stl")" 

5. generate possible grasp poses by following command
	python freegrip_fetch.py

6. then it should show a window to demonstrate all the posssible grasp poses in the object coordinate

7. modify the object name in manipulation/grip/freetabletopplacement.py
	"obj_path = os.path.join(this_dir, "objects", "bottle.stl")" -> "obj_path = os.path.join(this_dir, "objects", "[object name].stl")" 

8. generate possible stable placement with its feasible grasp pose
	python freetabletopplacement.py

9. you can access the database by
	mysql -u cogrob -p
	password: cogrob
